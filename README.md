# Project-2-Covid-Data
Preparation of CDC covid data for analysis by Emily Zinn, Aarvin Rathod, and Lydia Deterding.

Big Questions: Which state has the most cases/deaths, and which has the least? Is this correlated to the amount of vaccines given in that state? Does the type of vaccine matter (Pfizer vs. Moderna)? 

We pulled a dataset from https://worldpopulationreview.com/states that gives the estimated populations for each state. It also includes population density, which is relevant to this analysis as well.
